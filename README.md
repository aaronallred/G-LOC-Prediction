# G-LOC-Prediction
This repo serves as the primary location for the CU Boulder team's work on EDA, feature selection, and modeling scripts for psMOVE. 

This code operates via running a wrapper script (GLOCwrapper.m) to pull in raw centrifuge data and run desired trials through core code in ./library. Ensure that ./library is added to path before using. 

Output folders are ignored per user and are created on a daily basis.
